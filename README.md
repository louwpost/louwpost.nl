# LittleLink
The DIY self-hosted LinkTree alternative. LittleLink has more than 100 branded button styles you can easily use, with more regularly added by our community in this repo and in [LittleLink Extended](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink-extended).

This fork is mainly for my own website hosted @ louwpost.nl
